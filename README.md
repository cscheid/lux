# Lux: an EDSL for WebGL Graphics

**Lux** provides a set of primitives that make WebGL programming
easier and cleaner.

Specifically, Lux provides a novel way for Javascript code to
interoperate with WebGL code, especially when it comes to shader code.

In Lux 1.0, you'd write Lux shader code in the `Shade` EDSL. In Lux
2.0, you simply write (a subset of) Javascript, and that gets compiled
into shader code appropriately.
