# A vision for how Lux should work

`basic.js` illustrates how I think Lux code should be: positions and
colors are specified as Javascript functions, which are inspected and
compiled to WebGL shaders as necessary. 

I don't expect true polymorphism to be possible, but to some degree,
functional programming should be allowed.
