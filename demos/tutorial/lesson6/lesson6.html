<p>When we look at an object in real life, all of what we perceive
  from it comes from some light bouncing off of the object and
  reaching our eyes. It should come as no surprise, then, that a very
  large amount of generating realistic computer imagery comes from
  modelling the behavior of light appropriately. In this lesson, you
  will learn how to use two of the most basic lighting approaches,
  namely ambient sources, and completely diffuse, non-attenuating
  point lights. Even though computer graphics has existed for mor than
  50 years now, new lighting algorithms are still being actively
  developed! These Lux tutorials won't even scratch the surface of
  what's possible.</p>

<p>One property of physical light which is essentially always explored
  in lighting algorithms is <em>linearity</em>. The physical effects
  of multiple lights combine additively: the total effect produced by
  two lights is the equal to the sum of the effects of each
  light. This lets us design lighting algorithms one-light-at-a-time,
  and then add all the contributions in the end. Note that this does
  not mean that we perceive a light that is twice as powerful being
  twice as bright (even the most simplistic
  model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law">says
  differently</a>), but rather that photons
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics">don't
  generally interact with one another</a>.</p>

<h2>Ambient sources: No light, no images</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, all we can perceive is light. This means that
  if there's no light shining on the surface, it will appear to be
  pitch black. For a computer-generated image, a completely black
  image is rarely what you are going for, and so typically surface
  lighting algorithms start with a basic assumption that there is a
  small, constant amount of light reaching every possible surface
  point at every possible angle. This is what computer graphics folks
  call an <em>ambient</em> light source. Such a light source is
  completely impossible in real life, but is very convenient
  computationally. </p>

<p>For today's lesson, we will assume that the
  appearance of a material is completely determined by what we call
  the "material color", an RGB triple which tells us how much this
  material reacts to red, green and blue light, respectively. </p>

<p>Now, recall that light behaves linearly. If we assume that each
  photon comes with a specific color, (which is pretty close to what
  happens in physics), that photons are either red, green or blue
  (which is <em>not</em> that close to what happens in physics), and
  that light of a mixed color consists of a mixture of pure colors
  (which is close to what happens in physics), then linearity across
  light colors means can compute the amount of outgoing light one
  channel at a time, and combine the result.  We will encode the
  ambient light source intensity by another RGB triple, this time
  representing the amount of red, green and blue light being
  emitted. In addition, linearity <em>inside</em> each channel means
  that a red light source that's twice as powerful generates twice as
  much light bouncing off any material. Putting these observations
  together gives us the formula for ambient light sources:</p>

<p>TL;DR: the contribution of the ambient light source is the
  component-wise product of the material color and the light
  color.</p>

<pre class="highlight">
var ambient_light = Shade.Light.ambient({ 
    color: Shade.vec(1,1,1).mul(ambient_parameter)
});
// excerpt from <a href="https://github.com/cscheid/lux/blob/master/src/shade/light/ambient.js">Shade.Light.ambient</a>:
Shade.Light.ambient = function(light_opts)
{
    // ...
    return function(material_opts) {
        // ...
        return material_opts.material.mul(color);
    };
};
</pre>

<h2>Diffuse light sources: some directions look brighter than others</h2>

<p>TL;DR: the contribution of the diffuse light source is the
  component-wise product of the material color and the light color,
  multiplied by the negative of the dot product of the surface normal
  and the incident light direction.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.bake(model, {
    position: camera(cube_model_mat)(model.vertex),
    color: ambient_light(material_opts)
        .add(diffuse_light(material_opts))
})
</pre>

<h2>Addendum: Slider interaction</h2>
<p>Lux makes it easy for you to create simple interactive HTML sliders
  which correspond to a specific parameter. This is done by calling
  <a href="https://github.com/cscheid/lux/blob/master/src/lux/ui/parameter_slider.js">Lux.UI.parameter_slider</a>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- in your HTML; jquery UI is required (and included in the Lux distribution) --&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" href="/lib/ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.8.21.custom.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
  &lt;script src="lib/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
  .ui-slider .ui-slider-handle { 
      /* ... */
      /* look at the source of this HTML file for concrete examples */
  }
  .slider-div {
      /* ... */
      /* look at the source of this HTML file for concrete examples */
     margin-right: 18px;
  }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="slider-div" id="ambient"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;ambient&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="highlight">
// in your JS
var ambient_parameter = Shade.parameter("float", 0.3);
Lux.UI.parameter_slider({
    parameter: ambient_parameter,
    element: "#ambient",
    min: 0,
    max: 1
});
