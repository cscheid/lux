      <h1>Attributes 1: Defining attribute buffers</h1>
      <canvas id="webgl" width="720" height="480"></canvas>
      <p>Attribute buffers are Lux objects that encapsulate a stream
      of values that will be combined a few at a time to make WebGL
      primitives. For example, 3 consecutive values in an attribute buffer would
	make a triangle, or each value would make a separate point. </p>
      <p>In
      cases where your data doesn't change very often, you don't need
      to worry about attributes, since Lux will typically create one
      for you automatically. In fact, this is exactly
      what <tt>Lux.model</tt> has been
      doing for you behind the scenes when interpreting
      the <tt>vertex</tt> field.</p>

      <p>However, if you have dynamic data, you
      don't want to have to create a new actor every time, since
      creating an actor is slow (due to creating GPU programs
      associated with it). With <b>attribute buffers</b>, you can
      change the stream of values dynamically without changing the
      actor (similarly to how Lux parameters work).
      </p>
      <h2>Creating attribute buffers</h2>
<pre class="highlight">
var x_array = new Float32Array(n_points);
x_array[0] = 2; 
// ... etc. in your code, initialize x_array as necessary.
var x_buffer = Lux.attribute_buffer({
    item_size: 1,
    vertex_array: x_array
});
</pre>
<p>The value of <span class="inline-highlight">item_size</span>
  determines whether the stream of values will be interpreted as a
  stream of float, vec2, vec3 or vec4 values.</p>
      <h2>Using attribute buffers</h2>
<p>Attribute buffers behave like Shade values of the appropriate type:</p>
<pre class="highlight">
var dots = Lux.Marks.dots({
    position: scale(Shade.vec(x_buffer, y_buffer)),
    elements: n_points
});
</pre>
<h2>Changing attribute buffer values</h2>
<p>Change attribute buffers by calling their set method:</p>
<pre class="highlight">
x_array[3] = 5;
x_array[6] = 7; // etc
x_buffer.set(x_array);
Lux.Scene.invalidate();
</pre>
<p>Notice you need to request a redraw manually. Lux isn't yet smart
  enough to know that a particular buffer is being used in a scene, so
  if you don't call <span class="inline-highlight">invalidate</span>,
  you will not see the changes in your scene.</p>
