<h1>Lesson 2</h1>

<canvas id="webgl" width="720" height="720"></canvas>
<p>
  In the <a href="lesson1.html">previous lesson</a>, we drew the
  airport locations by manually transforming latitudes and longitudes
  into screen coordinates. In this lesson, we will start
  looking at Lux transformation nodes. Tranformation nodes make
  programs simpler and more expressive by giving Lux more information
  about the structure of the scene.
</p>

<p>
  For example, it is rarely the case that we will want to plot
  latitudes and longitudes like we did in lesson 1 by simply mapping
  them directly to window coordinates. There are several features
  we want in our visualization related to transformations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>We want to use a real map projection, like
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator</a> or
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection">Albers</a>. These
  define the way latitudes and longitudes become screen coordinates,
  and can be more complicated than an affine transformation.</li>
  <li>We want to control aspect ratio distortion: what if the window
  is 900x300 pixels?</li>
  <li>We want to be able to zoom in to specific regions of the map, or
  zoom out to have a global view. Similarly, we want to drag the map
  around to change the viewing window.</li>
  <li>We want to select regions of the map by clicking with the mouse.
  Mouse events are fundamentally in screen coordinates, but we want to have
  programmatic access to the region coordinates in the coordinate
  system that the data is defined, so we can do things
  like <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=Linking_and_Brushing">brushing
  and linking</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We start by picking a map projection. In this tutorial we will use
  the venerable (<a href="http://xkcd.com/977/">if understandably
  frowned upon</a>) Mercator projection. This means that at some point
  in the code, latitudes and longitudes must be transformed into
  Mercator coordinates. The straightforward way to do it would be to
  encode the new values directly on the position attribute of the
  <span class="inline-highlight">dots</span> object. You'd call a
  function like the following:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
// from <a href="https://github.com/cscheid/lux/blob/master/src/shade/scale/geo/latlong_to_mercator.js">Lux's source code</a>
Shade.Scale.Geo.latlong_to_mercator = Shade(function(lat, lon)
{
    lat = lat.div(2).add(Math.PI/4).tan().log();
    return Shade.vec(lon, lat);
});
</pre>

<p>Then, instead of writing</p>

<pre class="highlight">
var dots = Lux.Marks.dots({
    position: Shade.vec(lats, lons).radians(),
// ...
</pre>

<p>you'd write:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
// This is not how the current example works!
var dots = Lux.Marks.dots({
    position: Shade.Scale.Geo.latlong_to_mercator(lats.radians(), lons.radians()),
// ...
</pre>

<p>With a simple piece of code like we have right now, this would
  almost be good enough, but there's a variety of reasons you don't
  want to do it. First, imagine you needed to add a new element to
  your visualization that also uses latitude and longitude as
  coordinates. Then you'd have to manually make sure that the same
  transformation is applied to this element. And what happens if you
  change the map projection? Instead, the current example works by
  adding a new <em>subscene</em> to Lux's main scene; one that
  specifies that we are in fact working with latitudes and
  longitudes, and that we want to see the result of a Mercator
  projection:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
var dots = Lux.Marks.dots({
    position: Shade.vec(lats, lons).radians(),
    // ...
});
var lat_lon_scene = Lux.Scene.Transform.Geo.latlong_to_mercator();
lat_lon_scene.add(dots);
</pre>

<p>Notice that the <span class="inline-highlight">dots</span> object
  is unchanged. The way this works is simple and general. Remember
  that Lux uses <a href="/lux/demos/tutorial/lesson1.js">actors with
  appearances</a> to specify how things are drawn. When actors are
  added to a scene, their appearances are transformed depending on the
  scene they are in. In addition, if scene A contains scene B, then
  the apperances of actors in scene B are transformed by scene B, then
  by scene A (and so on for arbitrarily nested transformations).
</p>

<p>The Mercator projection implemented in Lux leaves longitudes
  unchanged, which means that the traditional Mercator square
  (covering latitudes roughly in the range [-85, 85]) is mapped to a
  square with range [-&pi;, &pi;] in both coordinates. This puts the
  United States area outside the WebGL normalized view extent of [-1,
  1], so if we were to leave the visualization like that, you
  <a href="lesson1b.html">would not see much</a>. </p>

<p>In order to see the US airports, we need an additional
  transformation to take the Mercator coordinates into the [-1, 1]
  range. We will do this by creating a new subscene with an explicit
  transformation function:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
var zoom_scene = Lux.scene({transform: function(appearance) {
    appearance.position = appearance.position.div(3);
    return appearance;
}});
</pre>
  
<p>We then add the mercator projection scene to the zooming scene, and
  the zooming scene to the main scene:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.Scene.add(zoom_scene);
zoom_scene.add(lat_lon_scene);
</pre>

<p>Notice that the each scene now contains objects that take one
  coordinate system and transform to another, from latitudes and
  longitudes to projected Mercator coordinates to screen
  coordinates. This separation of concerns will bring concrete
  advantages very soon. In the <a href="lesson3.html">next lesson</a>, we will start adding
  interactive capabilities to the visualization.</p>
