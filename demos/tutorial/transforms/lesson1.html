  In this series of examples, we will build an interactive
  visualization of the locations of US airports. Little by little, we
  will build features that showcase the Lux scene graph
  infrastructure, walk through its features, and show how they
  simplify many of the typical programming tasks underlying
  interactive features. If you like diving in the code to get a feel
  for what it looks like, I encourage you to skip the text below and
  read the source right away. Otherwise, read on for longer explanations.
</p>
<p>We start by initializing Lux and loading a JSON file containing the
  airport information:</p>
<pre class="highlight">
    Lux.init();
    Lux.Net.json("airports.json", create);
</pre>
<p>The function <span class="inline-highlight">create</span> will
  create the visualization elements. The airport locations are given
  in latitude-longitude pairs, so we create the buffers that will let
  Lux associate these values with the points we will draw:</p>
<pre class="highlight">
function create(json)
{
    var lats = make_buffer(json, "lat"),
        lons = make_buffer(json, "lon");
</pre>
<p>The coordinates that WebGL uses to address positions on a canvas
  are always normalized between -1 and 1 in all dimensions. This means
  that if we want to plot latitudes and longitudes, we need to
  transform them to the correct screen positions. In theory we could
  do this in Javascript and send WebGL the transformed positions every
  time, but this is not very efficient since we're dealing with more
  that 20 thousand points, and we want, in the future, to update the
  visualization at interactive rates. The solution is to create a
  transformation to be performed on the graphics card, by WebGL:</p>
<pre class="highlight">
    var scale = Shade.Scale.linear(
        {domain: [Shade.vec(-180, -90), Shade.vec(180, 90)],
         range: [Shade.vec(-1, -1), Shade.vec(1, 1)]});
    var position = scale(Shade.vec(lons, lats));
</pre>
<p>The variable <span class="inline-highlight">scale</span> is storing
  a linear transformation (actually an <em>affine</em> transformation if you're
  nitpicking), that sends the vector [-180, -90] to [-1, -1], and the
  vector [180, 90] to [1, 1] (y coordinates in WebGL
  increase as you go <em>up</em> the canvas). This transformation is
  then applied to a vector representing the position of the point,
  <span class="inline-highlight">Shade.vec(lons, lats)</span>. The
  variable <span class="inline-highlight">position</span> now holds an
  expression that denotes the result of transforming each element of
  the buffers we created by the specified linear transformation and
  representing them as 2D vectors.</p>
<p>We now create a visual primitive with the given position, and add
  it to the scene graph:</p>
<pre class="highlight">
    Lux.Scene.add(Lux.Marks.dots({
        position: position,
        fill_color: Shade.color("white"),
        stroke_width: 1,
        elements: json.length
    }));
}
</pre>
<p>In this lesson, we hand-coded performed the transformation from
  latitude-longitude to screen coordinates. This is sufficiently
  convenient in a trivial example like this, but makes further changes
  in the code more complicated. We will now start modifying this
  example to take advantage of some powerful Lux features. In
  the <a href="lesson2.html">next lesson</a>, we will learn about Lux
  transformation nodes.</p>
