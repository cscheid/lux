<h1>Lesson 3</h1>

<div>Pan by dragging, zoom by scrolling with your mouse</div>
<canvas id="webgl" width="720" height="720"></canvas>
<p>In this lesson, we will start to add interactive features to our
  visualization. Panning around, and zooming in and out of a picture is one of the
  simplest navigation tasks available. In a computer graphics
  application, this is typically done by managing a
  <a href="http://www-users.aston.ac.uk/~cornford/cs2150/pdf/window2vp_lec_8up.pdf">"world
  to viewport transformation"</a>. That is, we create a coordinate
  system that we consider to be "the world", and then map a region of
  the world to the extent of the screen. 
</p>
<p>We add interactivity by map actions in screen space (like panning a
  map, or zooming into a particular pixel) to changes in this
  world-to-viewport transformation. This combination of event
  handling (mouse clicks, drags, moves, etc) and coordinate
  transformations is managed by Lux by an <em>interactor</em>. To
  enable simple zooming and panning interaction to a Lux
  visualization, one adds an interactor object to the initialization routine:
</p>
<pre class="highlight">
Lux.init({
    interactor: Lux.UI.center_zoom_interactor({zoom: 0.3}),
// ...
</pre>
<p>The interactor object does a few things. First, it replaces the
  default Lux scene with one that performs a correct window-to-canvas
  transformation. This makes it easy to support canvases of different
  proportions; compare <a href="lesson2b.html">this</a> (bad)
  to <a href="lesson3b.html">this</a> (better). More importantly, it
  knows how to change the transformation in case the user drags the
  mouse around. Try panning the map, or zooming in (by scrolling) at a
  specific position. This transformation obviously influences how the
  dots are drawn. Because a Lux scene includes the transformation
  infrastructure, the <span class="inline-highlight">dots</span>
  object is automatically handled by virtue of being inside the
  interactor scene.
</p>

<p>The resulting code is nicely structured. The specification of
  <span class="inline-highlight">dots</span> is only concerned with
  its own coordinate system, and the specification of the
  window-to-viewport transformation is only concerned with how to
  translate the mouse events to the right transformation
  parameters.</p>

<h2>Extra material</h2>

<p>The following is a deeper discussion of issues that arise in
  graphics applications and drive some of the decisions behind
  Lux. The discussion will help you understand the philosophy
  behind Lux, but is skippable if you are only interested in using
  Lux.</p>

<h2>Handling interactions requires inverse transformations</h2>

<p>Even though the interactor transformed the position attribute of
  the <span class="inline-highlight">dots</span> object
  from <em>world</em> coordinates to <em>canvas</em> coordinates,
  computing the right viewport transformation from user interaction is
  a transformation in the <em>opposite</em> direction! This happens
  because mouse events (and user interactions in general) is given in
  screen coordinates.
</p>

<p>If we're performing all transformations manually, not only do we have
  to make sure that they're done for every object in the program, we
  also have to separately implement (and keep track of) the correct
  inverses, in case we need to use it later. In Lux, you'll still need
  to implement both the function and its inverse, but you can tell Lux
  about this relationship, and Lux will be able to use it. We will
  come back to this point when adding interactive selection of regions.
</p>

<h2>Transformations happen on the GPU, but event handling
  happens on the CPU</h2>

<p>Perhaps the main reason for the existence of Lux is bridging the
  gap that exists between programming in a graphics API like WebGL and
  the rest of a computer graphics program. This is a serious problem
  that causes all sorts of code duplication in a computer graphics
  application.</p>

<p>As illustration, consider the following. How would inverting the window-to-viewport
  transformation look like in an API that used WebGL for
  forward-transforming a point (for performance reasons), but the CPU
  for back-transforming it (because we need to convert the mouse
  position appropriately)? The forward transformation would be implemented in
  GLSL (so that we used the GPU), but the backward transformation
  would be implemented in Javascript. So not only we would have two
  separate functions, but they would be implemented in two separate
  languages.</p>

<p>Lux, on the other hand, knows about the semantics
  of <span class="inline-highlight">Shade</span> expressions, and can
  convert them to GLSL if necessary, but can also evaluate them
  directly in Javascript. As a result, if you write the
  transformations using <span class="inline-highlight">Shade</span>
  expressions, they can be executed wherever it's more
  convenient. This means we can, for
  example, <a href="/lux/test_transforms.js">write test suites</a>
  that check if transform functions are actually inverses of each
  other and, more generally,
  use <span class="inline-highlight">Shade</span> expressions.</p>

<h2>Aside: the OpenGL &lt;3.0 matrix stack</h2>

<p>(If you've never used the venerable OpenGL matrix stack, feel free
  to ignore this aside.) Another interesting thing about the Lux scene
  graph transformation is that it is a really small and
  straightforward extension of the OpenGL matrix stack. Pushing and
  popping matrices on the matrix stack is classically equivalent to
  adding affine transform scene graph nodes in APIs like
  OpenSceneGraph. </p> 

<p>In Lux, on the other hand, we have the ability to transform the
  vertex and fragment program specifications. The matrix stack can be
  directly implemented in terms of transformations that only involve
  matrix multiplication. In addition, nonlinear transformations like
  geographical projections are implemented in the same way, and
  transformations can be used to change other aspects of the
  visualization completely independently. </p>

<p>This seems to be a powerful
  way to structure graphics programs. For example Recording the depth of a
  fragment (used for shadow mapping, for example) is done simply by
  adding a transformation that replaces the color with an encoding of
  the z position; picking replaces the color with an object id;
  implementing a color-blindness simulator is a matter of creating a
  transformation that projects the fragment colors into the right
  subspace, and adding the objects into the new scene.
</p>

<h2>Lux is a big hammer, but graphics programming is a tough nail</h2>

<p>Lux includes a compiler of Shade expressions to GLSL, and an
  interpreter that matches much of the GLSL semantics. On first
  inspection it seems like implementing such a large amount of
  programming-language technology is massive overkill. However,
  <em>not</em> having a programming-language level
  integration between Javascript and WebGL brings much worse
  consequences for programming on the resulting API. I currently know
  of no other way to build library-level abstractions that reuse
  shader code, and that avoid the code duplication that ends up
  littering the vast majority of graphics program. That's mostly the
  reason I wrote Lux: I think the source code of computer graphics
  programs is much messier than it needs to be. While I don't think
  Lux is anywhere near perfect, it seems to be a step in the right
  direction.
