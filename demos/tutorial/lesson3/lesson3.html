<p>Most of the time we want our graphical elements to be dynamic in
some way. For example, they might be animated in time, or responding
to user input. So far, all examples we have seen have static data. In
this lesson, you will create a simple dynamic actor.</p>

<p>The simplest way to create actors that change with time is to make
the vertex positions in an actor depend on the time since the page
loaded. Naively, we might think of creating a new actor with new model
positions at every clock tick, since that is what we have seen until
now. This is a bad idea in general: creating new actors involves a
number of WebGL calls that are slow. </p>

<p>A better idea is to tell Lux that the vertex position in your actor should
depend on some small number of <em>parameters</em>, which are
created ahead of time and changed as necessary to reflect the changing
state of the world. As these parameters change, so does the actor's
  appearance. Importantly, changing a parameter is fast.</p>

<p>Lux parameters can be created, but for this example, we
will use a parameter predefined by Lux, namely
<tt>now</tt>:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
var angle = Lux.now().mul(50).radians();
</pre>

<p>The notation used above to express the value stored
in <tt>angle</tt> is a little different
than you might have expected. To explain it, we need to get into a
little more detail about Lux.</p>

<h3>Lux expressions are GPU computations are Javascript values</h3>

<p>One of the fundamental features in Lux is the ability to manipulate
expressions which represent <strong>computations to be performed on
the GPU</strong>. When you program in WebGL directly, these
computations are specified by vertex and fragment shaders. These are
written in a separate programming language, compiled and called mostly
as a black box, as far as Javascript is concerned. This separation of
two worlds makes writing software that uses shaders awkward. In
Lux, on the other hand, we insist that every GPU computation be
expressed as a Javascript value. Notice that Lux is not
precomputing values for the GPU ahead of time; rather, Lux lets you
build expressions which it can later compile into GPU
computations. Let's now look at how to build these types of
expressions.</p>

<p>The variable <tt>now</tt> contains a
value that represents the number of seconds elapsed since the context
was created. This value can be used to specify the color of a
vertex, where the red component of
the square's color would be alternating between zero and one depending
  on the amount of elapsed time:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.actor({
    model: square_model, 
    appearance: { 
        position: square_model.vertex,
        color: Shade.vec(now.sin().add(1).div(2), 0.5, 0.5, 1)}});
</pre>

<p>Notice that the variable <tt>now</tt>
does not store a number, but rather an object from which you can build
new objects. You can see that the resulting expression denotes
one half plus half the sine of the parameter, but it is important to notice
that <tt>(Math.sin(now)+1)/2</tt>
would <em>not</em> work! The moral of the story is that these
expressions can be combined to build more complicated expressions
which denote interesting computations. This is what's happening in the
assignment
to <tt>angle</tt> as well. If <em>s</em> is the
number of elapsed seconds,
then <tt>now</tt> represents the
value <em>s</em>, <tt>now.mul(50)</tt>
represents the value <em>50*s</em>,
and <tt>now.mul(50).radians()</tt>, in
turn, represents the value <em>50*s*(pi/180)</em>.</p>

<p>We will use <tt>angle</tt> to rotate
the vertex positions before translating them. Notice
that <tt>Shade.translation</tt>
and <tt>Shade.rotation</tt> behave like
functions, just like <tt>camera</tt>
does. In the following
example, <tt>Shade.rotation(angle,
Shade.vec(1, 0, 0))</tt> denotes a transformation, that when applied
to a vertex <em>v</em>, will return an expression denoting a vertex
rotated <em>angle</em> radians around the vector <em>[1,0,0]</em>:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.Scene.add(Lux.actor({
    model: square, 
    appearance: {
        position: camera(
            Shade.translation( 1.5, 0, -6)(
                Shade.rotation(angle, Shade.vec(1, 0, 0))(
                    square.vertex),
        color: Shade.vec(now.sin().add(1).div(2), 0, 0, 1)}}));
</pre>

<p>As you can see, Lux expressions are built either by taking a known
expression and calling some method on it, or by building it from
scratch from the <tt>Shade</tt>
object.</p>

<p>Lux currently has no way of knowing that your scene is
dynamic and should be regularly redrawn. So you tell it explicitly,
like so:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.Scene.animate();
</pre>
